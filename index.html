//This is my java script. I am going to write a programme that describes the different objects in the room.
//Then, I am going to console  log those objects.
//This programme will include a string, an array, a boolean, a number and an object"

//This is a string. It describes my location.
var myLocationString = "Church Compound";
console.log("The name of myLocationString is");
console.log(myLocationString);
console.log(" ");


//This is a number. It specifies my location.
var gateNumber = 1;
console.log("Main entry is from Gate Number");
console.log(gateNumber);
var anotherGate = 5;
console.log("Another way to enter is Gate Numeber");
console.log(anotherGate);
console.log(" ");

//This is a boolean. This describes the floor of my location.
var myFloorNumberIsFour = true;
console.log("Is my flat on fourth floor?");
console.log(myFloorNumberIsFour);
console.log("Is Main gate number greater than another gate number?")
console.log(gateNumber>anotherGate);
console.log(" ");


//Now I am going to create an array. The array will describe the objects in my room.

var myDescribingLine = ("Few things in my room are");
console.log(myDescribingLine);
var myRoomArray = ['Bookshelf','Mirror','Bed','Bag'];
console.log(myRoomArray);

//This is a variable for the length of myRoomArray. It is one higher than the number of my final object.
var myRoomArrayLength = myRoomArray.length;
console.log(myRoomArrayLength);

var lastItem = myRoomArray[3];
console.log(lastItem);
console.log(" ");


//Now I will create an object to describe one of my book.

var bookshelf = { name:"Unlocking Tibet",
author:"Wang Lixiong and Woeser",
year:2006,
issues:["Politics","Tibet","China", "International Policies"],
};
console.log(bookshelf);
var bookshelfissues = bookshelf.issues;
